# Bingo Game in JavaFX

This is a simple Bingo game implemented in Java using JavaFX. The application allows users to play Bingo by randomly drawing numbers and marking them on a 5x5 game board. The game includes features for drawing numbers, marking cells, and checking for winning patterns.

## Features

- **Randomized Bingo Board**: The game board is initialized with random numbers ranging from 1 to 75, with a free space in the center.
- **Draw Numbers**: Users can draw a new number by clicking a button or pressing the Enter key. Drawn numbers are displayed on the screen.
- **Cell Marking**: Players can mark cells on the board when the drawn number matches a cell's value. The center cell is marked by default.
- **Winning Detection**: The game checks for winning patterns after each number is drawn, including rows, columns, and diagonals.
- **Restart Functionality**: Players can restart the game, which resets the board and drawn numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used for developing the game logic.
- **JavaFX**: A framework for building the graphical user interface.
